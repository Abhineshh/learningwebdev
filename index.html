        flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied 
        flex: 1 to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that 
        every div ends up the exact same size. If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x
         the size of the others.
